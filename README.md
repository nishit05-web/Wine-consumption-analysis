# Wine-consumption-analysis
IN THIS ANALYSIS I HAVE EXTRACTED AND VISUALZED DATA OF WINE CONSUMPTION IN THE US
FROM THE ANALYSIS I GOT TO KNOW THAT THE CONSUMPTION IS MAXIMUM AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A PHD DEGREE
PEOPLE OF ALL INCOME GROUPS HAVING NO CHILDREN ALSO HAVE A HIGHER CONSUMPTION THAN PEOPLE WITH INCOME HAVING CHILDREN
PEOPLE WITH HIGHER INCOME CONSUMER MORE WINE MAYBE BECAUSE OF ITS COST
POEPLE AGED 80 ARE THE HIGHEST CONSUMERS OF THE WINE INDUSTRY
I ALSO PERFORMED CLUSTER ANALYSIS USED MATPLOTLIB
